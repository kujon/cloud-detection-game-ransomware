# cloud-detection-game-ransomware
Encrypts all the data on your hard drive until you have manually encircled all the clouds in 100 of satellite images

## Abstract

Modern machine learning models require vast quantities of well classified data to be trained correctly. That translates to thousands of person hours spent manually labelling the data.

With the advancement of satellite imagery, terabytes of high resolution imagery became available, yet they remain out of reach for the AI applications due to the lack of labelled data sets.

We recognise that manual image classification can be a boring task. It is thus difficult for humans to be convinced to perform it.

To address this, we propose that, instead of making the task engaging to the end user (which has been widely proven to achieve mediocre performance), we make it compulsory. The quantity of correctly classified data can be much higher if it is not proportional to users' engagement and willingness to label it, but simply to the reach of the virus.

## Prerequisites

1. Java Virtual Machine
2. A web browser

## Running

```bash
> ./hold_to_ransom.sh
```

This will encrypt `dummy_directory` part of this repository, open the default browser and ask the user to start drawing rectangles around clouds that they can see in the image.
